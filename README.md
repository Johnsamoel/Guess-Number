<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

My project is about guessing the number by your device by your guidance and counting the number of rounds which your device took to guess the number.

### Built With

In this project I tented to used different technology to implement my idea in a proper way, First off I used React Native.js as a framework with the help of expo cli to implement the mobile application, I also tented to use organised and clean code.

Regarding the server side I used Node.js to create and api's.

- [React.js](https://reactnative.dev)
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/expo-cli)
